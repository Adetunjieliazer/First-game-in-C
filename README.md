# Basic game in c language

This program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it. It will give you hints if your guess is too high or too low and keep track of the number of attempts until you guess correctly.

## How to install

```
git clone git@github.com:Adetunjieliazer/First-game-in-C.git
chmod a+x game_in_c
./game_in_c
```
